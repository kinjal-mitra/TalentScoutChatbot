# 📽️`Project Overview`📽️

This project focuses on building a hiring chatbot. The goal of this project is to make the hiring process easy and smooth both for the company and the candidate.

# 🔬`How it works ?`🔬

 - 😊While the candidate is willing to get hired, it is presented with this chatbot.😊
 - The chatbot starts the conversation, giving a brief discription about the process.
 - The candidate is first asked about personal and candiature information which includes name, phone, email, country, role of employment and finally what are the tech stack of the candidate which will include his/her skills as well as the technologies the candiate has worked upon.😎
 - Once all the information about the candidate is affiliated the candiate is then directed to a new page for the question-answering round.
 - Questions gets generated by using the Large Language Models while using their APIs.
 - The questions generated are based on the tech stack mentioned by the candidate. With every correct answer the difficulty level of the subsequent question gradually increases.
 - After the questions gets generated, the questions is asked by the candidate one by one and a total of 5 questions gets asked.
 - Candidate is given the previledge to stop the interview at any given point of time by using the keyword "exit" in the chat.🏃🏃🏃

 # ⚓️`Installation Instructions`⚓️

 1. Create a new directory, using the command : 
 ```
 $: mkdir <file_name>
 ```

 2. Create virtual enviroment with respective name let's say 'myenv', using the command :
 ```
 $: python -m venv myenv
 ```

 3. Activate the virtual environment using the command :
 ```
 $: myenv\Scripts\activate
 ```

 4. Pull the code from github using the respective url, using the command :
 ```
 $: git clone https://github.com/kinjal-mitra/TalentScoutChatbot.git
 ```

 5. Once the code is pulled successfully to the machine install all the required packages using pip :
 ```
 $: pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 6. Create a dot-env `(.env)` file containing all the API key of the Large Language Model which will include API key of Anthropic in the format of :
 ```
 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "<API_KEY>"
 ```

 7. Run the streamlit app using the given command in the terminal :
 ```
 $: streamlit run main.py
 ```

 8. Start the interview process as per the instructions provided.
 

 # 💻`Technical Details `💻

`Libraries` : The main libraries used are : langchain, langgraph and streamlit.

`Model` : The model is build using `Langgraph` and `Anthropic` Model is used as the Large Language Model.

# Prompt Design & Execution Flow

This section explains how the TalentScout AI Interviewer prompt is structured to conduct adaptive, progressive technical interviews based on a candidate's declared tech stack.

---

### 🎯 Objective

To conduct a **5-question technical screening** tailored to each candidate’s:
- **Years of experience**
- **Desired position**
- **Tech stack**

Questions progress in difficulty from **basic** to **expert** level, with adaptive logic based on candidate responses.

### 🧠 Prompt Strategy Overview

| Element              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role**             | Acts as a technical interviewer for TalentScout, a tech recruitment agency |
| **Context Inputs**   | Uses candidate's experience, desired role, and tech stack from session state|
| **Primary Task**     | Generate 5 progressive questions related to the tech stack                  |
| **Adaptive Flow**    | Advances to higher difficulty on correct answers; stays at the same level but changes topic on incorrect answers |
| **Response Style**   | Concise, professional, encouraging, and scenario-driven                     |
| **Question Format**  | Mix of theoretical and practical, directly relevant to tech stack            |

### 🧩 Difficulty Progression Logic

| Question | Focus Area                          | Target Level |
|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| Q1       | Fundamental concepts                | Beginner     |
| Q2       | Basic implementation or usage       | Junior       |
| Q3       | Intermediate application            | Mid-level    |
| Q4       | Advanced usage or architecture      | Senior       |
| Q5       | Expert-level problem solving/design | Expert       |

---

### 🔄 Adaptive Questioning Rules

- ✅ **Correct answer** → Proceed to the next difficulty level  
- ❌ **Incorrect answer** → Stay at the same level, switch to a different topic in the stack  
- ⚠️ **Never downgrade** difficulty due to a wrong answer

### 🧰 Tech Stack Adaptation Examples

| Stack Type     | Focus Areas                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**   | Components, lifecycle, hooks, state, SSR/SSG           |
| **Backend**    | APIs, databases, authentication, microservices         |
| **Database**   | Indexing, normalization, ACID, data modeling           |
| **Cloud**      | CI/CD, serverless, service selection, scaling          |
| **DevOps**     | IaC, Docker/K8s, monitoring, logging, security         |

# Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                  | Solution                                                                 
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Formatting with Streamlit** | Streamlit’s layout made it difficult to clearly display questions and answers. Used `st.container()`, `st.empty()`, and `st.form()` for dynamic updates, plus Markdown and sidebar/columns for cleaner formatting. 
| **Maintaining Session State** | Needed to remember candidate info, current question, and responses across steps. Leveraged `st.session_state` to persist progress, store answers, and control adaptive question flow without losing context. 


# Future Improvements

| Area                         | Potential Enhancement                                                                 
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **UI & Styling**              | Add custom CSS or use Streamlit components for more polished layouts and branding.     
| **Data Persistence**          | Store candidate responses and evaluation logs in a database for long-term tracking. (In Progress)    
| **Advanced Evaluation**       | Incorporate automated scoring or LLM-based assessment to provide richer feedback.      
| **Multi-User Support**        | Enable multiple interview sessions in parallel with unique session identifiers.        
| **Integration with ATS**      | Connect results directly to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for recruiter workflow.
